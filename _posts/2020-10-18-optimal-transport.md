What is the most efficient way to transport and modify a pile of sand into another one? \\
This is the question that prompted brilliant scientists like Monge, Kantorovich, Villani and Figali to investigate the theory of transport between two distributions. Today, optimal transport is an invaluable theory for comparing probability distributions, and it yields countless applications in computer vision or machine learning.

- [Aude Genevay](https://audeg.github.io/) is a postdoc in the Geometric Data Processing group at MIT, USA. Her research is focused on the interaction between optimal transport and machine learning. She earned her PhD on [Entropy-Regularized Optimal Transport for Machine Learning](https://audeg.github.io/publications/these_aude.pdf) under the direction of Gabriel Peyré.
- [Anton Mallasto](https://sites.google.com/view/antonmallasto/home) is a postdoc in the Probabilistic Machine Learning Group at Aalto University, Finland. His main research interests revolve around the analysis of random objects in complex geometries, where he finds inspiration in optimal transport. He earned is PhD on [Geometric Methods in Probabilistic Modelling](https://curis.ku.dk/portal/files/233743401/Mallasto_PhD_thesis_copy.pdf) under the supervision of Åsa Feragen.
