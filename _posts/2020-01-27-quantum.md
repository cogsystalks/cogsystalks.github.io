<!-- # CogSys Talks presents: Quantum Machine Learning -->

Quantum computers trigger a growing interest in the scientific community since they aim to solve highly complex problems
in a reasonable time. This can be achieved by using Qubits, equivalent of classical bits, obtained by the superposition
and entanglement of two quantum states. Redefining the core of a computer system means that specific algorithms need to be
looked out, to be exploited. How are those algorithms designed? Do we actually have quantum computers available?

For our very first event, we are excited to welcome Arthur and Jonathan:

  - [Arthur](https://artix41.github.io/) was previously working at Xanadu and 1QBit. He will give us an
  introduction about quantum machine learning "beyond the hype".
  - [Jonathan](http://jonathanfoldager.com/) is a PhD student at CogSys, working on the implementation of quantum
  machine learning models. He will talk about ensemble learning and quantum approximate optimization algorithm
