<!-- # CogSys Talks presents: Quantum Machine Learning -->

Quantum Computers aim to be the next generation of computers that can solve highly complex problems
that classical computers would fail to solve in a reasonable time. Because they are using Qubits,
obtained by the superposition and entanglement of two quantum states, specific quantum algorithms need
to be designed to be performed on a quantum computer.

How are those algorithms designed? Do we actually have quantum computers available?

For our very first event, we are excited to welcome Arthur and Jonathan, both working on quantum machine learning.

  - [Arthur](https://artix41.github.io/) was previously working at Xanadu and 1QBit. He will give us an
  introduction about quantum machine learning "beyond the hype".
  - [Jonathan](http://jonathanfoldager.com/) is a PhD student at CogSys, working on the implementation of quantum
  machine learning models. He will talk about ensemble learning and quantum approximate optimization algorithm
