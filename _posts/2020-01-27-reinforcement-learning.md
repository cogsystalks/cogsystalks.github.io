<!-- # CogSys Talks presents: Deep reinforcement learning -->

For our second event on deep reinforcement learning (RL), we were honoured to welcome Kai and Sebastian:

  - [Kai Arulkumaran](http://kaixhin.com/) just finished his PhD at the Imperial College London.
  He was previously intern at DeepMind, Facebook, and Microsoft research. His primary research focus is on Deep RL. \\
  Kai's tutorial is available [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lX4Qez4Je6uGInie0OsQC28jn2cpFEB5).

  - [Sebastian Risi](http://sebastianrisi.com/) is an associate professor at IT-University of Copenhagen.
  His research focuses on computational evolution, deep learning. Sebastian presented his recent [work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.01683) on innovation protection in deep RL. \\
  Sebastian's presentation is available [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1AQhghAw-V5o2DUGKwadJ_CHVCmFlIK2-).
