CogSys Talks has been primarily created to satisfy students' curiosity in the scope of machine learning
and applied mathematics. This initiative seemed to be the perfect excuse to invite external speakers,
which could both foster collaborations and spark new ideas in an interactive and social way.
<!--
For the moment, CogSys Talks is working on a voluntary basis. Inviting renowned speakers living outside
of Denmark has a cost, and we are currently looking for sponsors. If you would like to contribute to our events,
in one way or another, feel free to send us a email. -->
